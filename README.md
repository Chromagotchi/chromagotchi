Chromogotchi
=======

Chromogotchi is a virtual (tamagotchi-esque) pet that makes its home in your browser. Built as 
a Chrome extension, you are responsible for keeping your Chromogotchi well fed, well rested, 
and entertained. Fail to do so and your pet grows restless, eating and distorting the content 
in your web browser.

This was built as a hackathon project at hackTECH '14. Possible features to add in the future 
include making one pet persistent across your entire browser as it wanders between tabs, having 
the Chromogotchi attack ads on the webpage, audio, etc.
